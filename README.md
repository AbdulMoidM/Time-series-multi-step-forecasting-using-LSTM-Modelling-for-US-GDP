This is the codebase for a Data Mining research project I conducted with my partner, Vishad Pokharel. 
In this project, we predicted the future change in US GDP after the onset of COVID-19. We did so by using Keras, an open source neural-network library to train different LSTM models and choosing the best performing model based on their average normalized RMSE.
For our inputs, we acquired stock, US treasury, and GDP data from Quandl and processed it using Python scripts (details & codebase in link).
